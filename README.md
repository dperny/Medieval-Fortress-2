Medieval-Fortress-2
===================

A old, no longer functional Team Fortress 2 Sourcemod plugin, placed here for posterity


I wrote this Sourcemod plugin right around the advent of the Demoman's sword and sheild, as a follow up and improved version of the original plugin, which can still be found on the Allied Modders forum. 

The first iteration of this was written in about 2009 after the Sniper vs. Spy update, and this version (version 2.0.0) was released in early 2010 after the WAR! update.

This plugin is long since obselete. 
It uses really, really old methods of weapons checking that are no longer valid due to the vast number of weapons available.
Furthermore, I have no idea how much the Sourcemod API has changed in the last 4 years.
